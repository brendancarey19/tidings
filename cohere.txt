- A Memphis couple who took in former NFL offensive lineman Michael Oher when he was in high school deny in court documents that they used a legal agreement between them to get rich at his expense.
- The Tuohys' filing Thursday says they never signed any pro football contracts for Oher, and he was happy with their financial arrangements from "The Blind Side," a book and a movie about Oher's life.
- Oher's lawyer has said the Tuohys' agreement with Oher was a legal contract that made them his legal guardians and entitled them to a portion of his NFL earnings.
- The Tuohys' filing says Oher was a college prospect when the NCAA made it clear he could attend Ole Miss if he was part of the Tuohy family in some fashion.

- The Tuohy family, who were portrayed in the 2009 movie "The Blind Side," are denying that they used a legal agreement to get rich at Michael Oher's expense.
- Oher, a former NFL offensive tackle, is trying to end a conservatorship signed in 2004, when he was an 18-year-old high school football player in Memphis.
- He claims the Tuohys used the agreement to get him to go to the University of Mississippi, where he would be eligible to play football.
- The Tuohys deny these claims, saying they never signed any pro football contracts for Oher and he was happy with their financial arrangements from the movie.
